                            Triolingo is a language learning app akin to Duolingo, created solely for the personal use
                            of Rodger van der Heijden. It is not aimed at serving the needs of many, yet anyone that
                            does see its benefits is free to use this service. Do note however that many of its
                            essential features are not included in this web demo - please do contact me if you wish to
                            make use of the entire set of features.

                            Triolingo is a Flask app that allows language users more control over the process of
                            learning another language (in this case Polish specifically, though other backends should
                            theoretically be easy to slot in). It adds voice commands, has an option to select the
                            difficulty setting and number of questions and most importantly it provides the sentences in
                            order of personal (predicted) difficulty. The algorithm is adaptive; as your command of your
                            target language grows, easy quizzes will remain relatively just as easy as before - the
                            average difficulty of the sentences increases along your understanding.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h1>Learning modes</h1>
                        <p>
                            Though still limited on options - after all it's a WIP - several quizzing options exist.
                            Three possible methods of providing an answer (will) exist: using open text boxes, selecting
                            an answer in multiple choice or using your voice to say the answer. Users will soon (at
                            least, hopefully) be able to answer missing words in a sentence, provide translations of
                            entire sentences, select the correct declensions and conjugations or pick the word order to
                            create the sentence question.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h1>Measuring progress</h1>
                        <p>
                            Triolingo makes use of four 'progress meters': one overall language proficiency meter, and
                            one learning rate parameter for each difficulty setting (easy, moderate, difficult). The
                            expectation for easy quizzes is 80% correct, for moderate 60% and for difficult ones 30%.
                            Your actual quiz results determine how much the respective learning rate changes. With
                            repeated scores of 100% your language proficiency value will increase rapidly, sampling ever
                            increasingly difficult questions.
